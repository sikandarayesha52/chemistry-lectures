    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>In <b>1911</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> Rutherford has proposed a theory, purpose of which was to describe the structure of an atom. In his experiment he found that atom has most of its mass is present at centre, while remaining portion is predominantly marked by empty space </p>
    <h3>Experiment</h3>
    <p>Rutherford conducted a Gold Foil Experiment to understand the stucture of an atom. He has used alpha particles source inside lead container to ensure that these particles only pass through small opening. The purpose of using alpha particles rather than protons to hit electrons was,that these are heavier and have more energy. He placed gold foil to be bombarded by alpha particles. Foil was surrounded by florescent screen to detect the radiations when alpha particles hit it after passing through foil. </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Large no of rays were passed straight from foil</li>
        <li>Some rays were deflected to smaller angle</li>
        <li>Some radiations were bounced back</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Rutherford concluded that</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Most of space an atom is empty as most of rays have passed straight</li>
    <li>Central small portion is dense and positively charged as some radiations were bounced back or deflected to small angle</li>
    </ul>
